# real-time-chat
First time using react and node js for an application 


Based off this youtube video I followed through : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwFA3YMfkoc&t=631s&ab_channel=JavaScriptMastery

Learned about 
- Sokect.io
- React
- Node js
- Module practices 
- How to get my app working on the web ( have not done this part, but I know of the resources)
